# Setting up Certification Authority and signing certificate for testing purposes

Please refer to the [dedicated document](certs/README.md).

# Setup

## With Docker

The example can be built and tagged with:

`docker build -t pspdfkit/signing-server-example .`

Once built it can be run as:

```
docker run \
  --env SIGNING_SERVICE_PORT=6000 \
  --publish 6000:6000 \
  pspdfkit/signing-server-example:latest
```

This will make it accessible on the host machine at `http://localhost:6000`.

With Docker Compose, it can be setup along Nutrient Document Engine as:

```
services:
  signing_service:
    build: .
    environment:
      SIGNING_SERVICE_PORT: 6000
    ports:
      - 6000:6000
  document_engine:
    ...
    environment:
      SIGNING_SERVICE_URL: http://signing_service:6000/sign
```

See `docker-compose.yml` for a complete example.

## Without Docker

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

You can then:

- Run the example with `npm run start`
- Run tests with `npm test`

# How does it work

The application exposes the `/sign` endpoint that represents an implementation of Document Engine's signing service callback. Please refer to "Callbacks" section of Document Engine's `/sign` endpoint [reference](https://www.nutrient.io/api/reference/document-engine/upstream/#tag/Digital-Signatures/operation/sign-document) to understand the full protocol.

For an introduction to digital signing refer to our [digital signatures guides](https://www.nutrient.io/guides/document-engine/signatures/).

# Basic Usage

You can use Document Engine's API to sign document `my-document-id`:

```
curl -X 'POST' 'http://localhost:5000/api/documents/my-document-id/sign' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Token token="secret"' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
     "signingToken": "{\"userId\": \"user-1-with-rights\", \"signMethod\": \"privatekey\"}"
  }'
```

The request contains a `signingToken` attribute whose value is entirely under your control. The example in this repository shows how you can potentially use it to forward parameters for the signing process:
* `userId` as an authentication and authorization token that the signing service uses to determine if the caller of the API has enough rights to perform the signature.
* `signMethod` to instruct the example which of the available example signing methods to use.

Signing service should respond with `200` on success. If the signing service responds with an error in the `4xx` range, Document Engine will fail the original request with a `400` error, logging the response received by the signing service.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Refer to the [app.js](lib/app.js) file to discover how the signing service callbacks are implemented.

> üí° Note: The example logs all requests and responses to the `/sign` endpoint to give you better idea how Document Engine interacts with the signing service.

# Advanced Usage

Document Engine's digital signatures process can be customized simply by passing additional options during sign request:

```
curl -X 'POST' 'http://localhost:5000/api/documents/my-document-id/sign' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Token token="secret"' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "signatureContainer": "raw",
    "signatureType": "cades",
    "signingToken": "{\"userId\": \"user-1-with-rights\", \"signMethod\": \"privatekey\"}",
    "flatten": false,
    "estimatedSize": 16384,
    "hashAlgorithm": "sha256",
    "appearance": {
      "mode": "signatureOnly",
      "contentType": "image/png",
      "showSigner": true,
      "showReason": true,
      "showLocation": true,
      "showWatermark": true,
      "showSignDate": true
    },
    "position": {
      "pageIndex": 0,
      "rect": [
        0,
        0,
        100,
        100
      ]
    },
    "signatureMetadata": {
      "signerName": "John Appleseed",
      "signatureReason": "accepted",
      "signatureLocation": "Vienna"
    },
    "cadesLevel": "b-lt"
  }'
```

For detailed explanation of these options, refer to our [API reference](https://www.nutrient.io/api/reference/document-engine/upstream/#tag/Digital-Signatures/operation/sign-document)

# Signing with Private Key

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è [Source code](lib/examples/private-key-example.js)

## PKCS#7 Signing

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è [Source code](lib/examples/sign-private-key-pkcs7.js)

Document Engine sign request that creates CMS signature via PKCS#7 container created by the signing service:

```
curl -X 'POST' 'http://localhost:5000/api/documents/my-document-id/sign' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Token token="secret"' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
     "signatureContainer": "pkcs7",
     "signatureType": "cms",
     "signingToken": "{\"userId\": \"user-1-with-rights\", \"signMethod\": \"privatekey\"}"
  }'
```

> üí° Note that this example supports CMS signatures only.

Under the hood, Document Engine will call the signing service with the following request:

```
POST http://signing_service:6000/sign
Content-Type: application/json

{
  action: 'sign_pkcs7',
  digest: '<base16 encoded hash of the document>',
  encoded_contents: '<base64 encoded document contents>',
  signature_type: 'cms',
  signing_token: '{"userId": "user-1-with-rights", "signMethod": "privatekey"}'
}
```

When performing signing operation with `signatureContainer` set to `pkcs7` (default), signing service receives the byte range and a hash representation of the current state of the document. The signing service is responsible to digitally sign the digest and produce a valid PCKS#7 signature container, encoded in DER format and return it as a response body with status `200`. Document byte range is also provided as `encoded_contents` to allow signing service to calculate the digest manually before signing.

### Verify the Returned PKCS#7

```
curl http://localhost:6000/sign \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{"action": "sign_pkcs7", "digest : "<content-hash>", "encoded_contents" : "<base64-encoded-contents>", "signing_token" : "user-1-with-rights"}'
  | openssl pkcs7 -inform DER -text -print
```

## RAW Signing

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è [Source code](lib/examples/sign-private-key-pkcs7.js)

Document Engine provides an option to perform signing without producing PKCS#7 container.

For example, this sign request creates CAdES signature with raw signature:

```
curl -X 'POST' 'http://localhost:5000/api/documents/my-document-id/sign' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Token token="secret"' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
     "signatureContainer": "raw",
     "signatureType": "cades",
     "signingToken": "{\"userId\": \"user-1-with-rights\", \"signMethod\": \"privatekey\"}"
  }'
```

Under the hood, Document Engine will call the signing service with the following requests:

### 1. Get Certificates

When performing signing operation with `signature_type` `cades`, caller needs to provide a list of certificates used for signing either via signing request directly or via a signing service. If the certificates are not provided in the signing request, this callback will be invoked. It's strongly recommended to use the signing service callback for providing the certificates as this way you don't need to distribute them to your Document Engine API clients and can keep them collocated with the signing service.

```
POST http://signing_service:6000/sign
Content-Type: application/json

{ action: 'get_certificates' }
```

Signing service needs to respond with a JSON with base64 encoded PEM certificates.

```
{
  certificates: [
    '<base64 encoded PEM certificate>',
    '<base64 encoded PEM certificate>'
  ],
  ca_certificates: [
    '<base64 encoded PEM certificate>',
    '<base64 encoded PEM certificate>'
  ]
}
```

### 2. Signing Request

```
POST http://signing_service:6000/sign
Content-Type: application/json

{
  action: 'sign',
  data_to_be_signed: '<payload that needs to be signed by signing service>',
  hash_algorithm: 'sha256',
  signature_type: 'cades',
  signing_token: '{"userId": "user-1-with-rights", "signMethod": "privatekey"}'
}
```

When performing signing operation with `signatureContainer` set to `raw`, signing service receives a binary representation of the current state of the document. Signing service is responsible to digitally sign this payload and return `200` response with DER encoded [RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3447#section-8.2) payload.

# Signing via HSM

Document Engine signing module can easily integrate with a broad range of third-party devices or cloud services. For instance, integration with a Hardware Security Module (HSM) adds an additional level of security to document processing and management workflows. HSMs are special devices designed to safeguard sensitive data and cryptographic keys. By delegating cryptographic operations to an HSM, the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your documents are significantly enhanced.

This example shows how to implement signing via a software based HSM (SoftHSMv2) running locally. Clients interact with HSMs via [PKCS#11](https://www.cryptsoft.com/pkcs11doc/) interface. This means that this example should provide you with a good starting point in integrating with your specific HSM.

## Setup

### With Docker

If you run this example via the provided Docker file, the SoftHSM is already ready to use.

### Without Docker

To setup SoftHSM without Docker, follow these steps:

1. Install the [SoftHSMv2](https://github.com/opendnssec/SoftHSMv2) for the platform of your choice.
    1. If you are using macOS, you can install it via brew:
        ```sh
        brew install softhsm
        ```
    2. Take a note of the install location, you'll need it later:
        ```sh
        ==> Pouring softhsm--2.6.1.arm64_ventura.bottle.2.tar.gz
        üç∫  /opt/homebrew/Cellar/softhsm/2.6.1: 16 files, 2.6MB
        ```

2. [Generate test certificates](certs/README.md) if you haven't done so already.

3. Import the test private key into the HSM.
    1. Initialize the token with name test-key in the first free slot in the HSM.
       For example purposes, we are setting the PIN to 1234 and Security Officer pin to 0000.
       ```sh
       softhsm2-util --init-token --free --label test-key --pin 1234 --so-pin 0000
       ```
    2. Import the signer private key into the created slot. You can pick any ID and label.
       ```sh
       softhsm2-util --import certs/test-signer.key --token test-key --label test-key --id CAFED00D --pin 1234
       ```

4. Export your pin as env variable
   ```sh
   export HSM_PIN=1234
   ```

5. Export the location of your HSM module as env variable
   ```sh
   export HSM_MODULE=$(brew --prefix)/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so
   ```

5. Run the example as explained before:
   ```
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```

## HSM Signing Examples
